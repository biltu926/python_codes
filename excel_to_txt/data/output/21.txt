Can I make a name change to my flights?
All reservations must be made in the EXACT name of the person traveling - no nicknames. For domestic and international travel, the name on the reservation must be EXACTLY as it appears on the traveler's government issued identification or passport.  Airlines do not allow name changes due to heightened Homeland Security rules. However, in case you have made some error in spelling the name, please contact our Customer Service team at 844-709-9854 for assistance.
