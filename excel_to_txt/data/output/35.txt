How do I know if the airlines I'm flying have a baggage agreement?
Please look for baggage alert in your itinerary. If you have one it means the airlines do not have baggage agreement. Please call the airline you are flying, and confirm whether your baggage will be checked to your final destination or if you will have to claim your baggage when you change planes.
