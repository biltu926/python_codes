What happens to my checked baggage when I change planes?
If you are changing planes and the airlines you are flying have a baggage agreement, your baggage will be checked all the way through to your final destination. If the airlines you are flying do not have a baggage agreement, it will be the responsibility of the passenger to go to Baggage Claim at the very first airport, where you are changing planes to claim their baggage there. The passenger must then check their baggage in again for the continuing flight and have their bags checked to their final destination.
