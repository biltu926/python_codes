I have a confirmed reservation, but do not have a seat assignment. Does this mean I will not have a seat when I get to the airport?
Airlines do not pre-assign 100% of any aircraft. Along with Bulk Head and Emergency Exit row seating, there are also seats left unassigned for other airline employees, frequent flyer account holders, etc. If you have a confirmed booking, but do not have a seat assignment, it is very important you get to the airport at least three hours prior to the scheduled departure time, as these unassigned seats can only be assigned by airport ticket/gate personnel. At that point, seats will be assigned on a first come, first serve basis.
