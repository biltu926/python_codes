I have to cancel my flights. Can my tickets be refunded?
Most discounted airline tickets are non-refundable. Although non-refundable tickets are the most economical, they are also the most restrictive and do not allow refunds. These restrictions make it possible for Travelomind to continue to offer special sale fares in addition to our existing deeply discounted airfares. Please note, refund restrictions are documented on our website. You must agree to these terms and conditions prior to booking any reservation by selecting "Yes" to our contract agreement.  Once you decide to cancel a reservation, you are subject to the terms of the cancellation, as stated in our "Terms and Conditions".
