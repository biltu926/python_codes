Can I use frequent flyer miles to get a further discount or an upgrade?
No, our specially priced contract fares do not allow you to use frequent flyer miles for upgrade or further discount. Additionally, frequent flyer miles must be exchanged directly with the airline you have an account with or with your credit card company. Travelomind is unable to utilize your miles in any way.
