Are there any additional fees or taxes not included in the price I've paid for the ticket(s)?
Other than baggage fees mentioned in an earlier answered question, there are also Airport Entry and Exit fees. These fees are charged by the individual airports and are not collected by the travel agency or the airline. These fees are usually collected during the immigration and customs process, but again, you should call the airline you are flying to verify this in advance, so you are fully prepared upon your arrival.
