What is the status of a waiver that was requested on my reservation?
When a waiver is requested with the airline, Travelomind forwards all necessary documents directly to them on your behalf. It is at the discretion of the airline as to when they will review and/or process the request. Often times waivers are not granted until days before travel is due or months after travel should have commenced. We will keep you apprised of any additional documentation needed or when the waiver is approved or denied.
