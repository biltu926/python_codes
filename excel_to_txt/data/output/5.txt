How do I book an infant fare?
Infants, under the age of 24 months, traveling within the United States travel at no charge as long as they are seated on an adult's (over 18 years) lap. Only one infant is allowed to travel as a lap child per adult (over 18 years). Infants traveling internationally will be required to pay a percentage of the adult fare (in most circumstances), plus taxes and carry a paper ticket even though they are traveling on the adult's lap. Please contact our Customer Service team at 1-844-327-2373 or Chat on Facebook Messenger to book an infant ticket. Infant tickets cannot be purchased online.
