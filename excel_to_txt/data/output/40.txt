Can I earn frequent flyer miles on the tickets?
Most of our Airfares allow accumulation of frequent flyer miles. However, there are exceptions. Check the specific Airfare rules by clicking on the actual fare amount on the Fare Listing screen or email your Travelomind.com consultant. You must enter the frequent flyer number in Traveler Details for it to be transmitted to the Airlines. In fact, the Travelers Profile section lets you store and recall up to 8 different Airlines' frequent flyer numbers per client.
