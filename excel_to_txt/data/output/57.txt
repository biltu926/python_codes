Do I have to reconfirm my flight?
Yes. They should reconfirm international flights 72 hours in advance and domestic flights 24 hours in advance, by calling the Airline directly. Make sure they check for any schedule changes in their itinerary. Airlines reserve the right to cancel bookings if reservations are not reconfirmed, regardless if tickets have been issued or not.
