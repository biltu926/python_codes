The ticket confirmation e-mail I have received indicates that the airline does not guarantee the booking, what does this mean?
The email confirmation with a pending status means that the booking is still not confirmed with the airline. You will be emailed a confirmed itinerary once your credit card has been charged and tickets are issued. You may contact our Customer Service team at 1-844-327-2373 or Chat on Facebook Messenger for assistance.
