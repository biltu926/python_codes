What happens when "Exclusive fares" are sold out?
Once "Exclusive Fares" are sold out, the price of the ticket will move to the next highest fare level. If your travel dates are flexible, please try to enter new travel dates and search again. An "Exclusive Fare" may still be available to the same destination, but on a different date. If you're still unable to locate one of our "Exclusive Fares", Please contact our Customer Service team at 1-844-327-2373 or Chat on Facebook Messenger for further assistance..
