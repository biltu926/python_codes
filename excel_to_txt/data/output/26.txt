My ticket confirmation e-mail shows ##MAN##, what does that mean?
"MAN" means the flights you selected were not booked in our system automatically and a manual request has been generated. One of our agent needs to manually process your booking and confirm your itinerary. We will contact you to confirm the exact itinerary and the cost of your ticket within 24 hours.
