Why should I buy the travel protection plan?
Even the best-planned travel can be impacted by unforeseen sickness, or medical emergency, delayed flights, passport theft or baggage delays. Troubles can occur when you least anticipate them forcing you to cancel or interrupt your trip, lose your ticket investment, and incur unplanned expenses. By purchasing a travel protection plan, you are protecting your trip investment against the unknown.
