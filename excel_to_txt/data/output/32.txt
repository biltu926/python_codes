How do I travel with an E-Ticket (Electronic Ticket)?
Most airlines now offer electronic tickets and allow you to travel without a paper ticket, which eliminates the worry of loss or theft of your paper tickets. While traveling with e-tickets, please carry government issued photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport) to the airport. With some airlines, you may check-in online and print your boarding pass up to 24 hours in advance. Passengers must have a printed boarding pass in order to proceed through security. Customers with checked-in baggage or E-tickets who do not have a printed boarding pass must go to the ticket counter prior to going through the security checkpoint. It is advisable that you reconfirm your flights at least 72hrs prior to departure directly with the airline. Please click here for a list of airline phone numbers.
