What documents do I need to go through airport security?
For domestic flights, you will need your Boarding Pass, any government or state issued photo ID such as a driver license or passport along with a copy of your itinerary/trip details. Please note that a valid passport is required for all air travel outside of the United States. In addition to a passport, many countries require a visa for entry.
