What are your cancellation fees?
All airline tickets are 100% non-refundable. In certain cases where the airline may allow cancellations, a credit may be valid towards a future ticket purchase by the same traveler with travel on the same airline. An applicable penalty and a fare difference (if any), will be added in these cases.  A cancellation fee starting from $50 per person per ticket must be paid to us at the time of cancelling the booking; we retain this fee. The credit will be held for a limited time period, please ask the customer service agent for the specific date by when you must use this credit or you will lose the credit amount.
