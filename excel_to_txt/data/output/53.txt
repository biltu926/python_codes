What are the different classes of service on the plane?
In addition to Coach/Economy class seating, many flights offer Business, and/or First Class seating. Please note that the following descriptions are generalizations; some airlines may use different names to describe their classes of service. 1. Coach/Economy class is seating is in the main cabin area. These seats are usually the least expensive. 2. Business class seating--when available--tends to feature roomier seats that recline farther, more leg room, and upgraded meal service.  Business class tickets cost more than Coach/Economy but less than First Class. 3. First class seating is usually in the cabin area nearest the front of the aircraft. It has the fewest and most comfortable seats, and offers upgraded meals. Other perks can include shorter lines at check-in and use of the airline's airport business lounge. First Class fares are almost always the most expensive, and are not available on all aircraft. Flight options 1.
