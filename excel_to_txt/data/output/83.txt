How do I obtain a breakdown of the taxes on my reservation?
Given the complexities of tickets to include airport, arrival and departure taxes and fuel surcharges, we recommend you contact the airline directly for a specific breakdown. Your email confirmation will provide total charges including all taxes and fees.
