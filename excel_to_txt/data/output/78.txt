I cancelled my booking the same day I made it. When will the charges be credited?
When a reservation is cancelled the same day it was booked, funds for the airline portion are not collected. Any pending charges you may have seen would have been a "pending hold" for verification. These funds will return to your available credit and will not reflect as a refund. This process normally takes from 3-7 business days, depending on your banking institutions procedures. Please note: Some prepaid credit card companies will hold pending authorizations for up to 30 days.
