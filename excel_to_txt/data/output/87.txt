Why is there an international/foreign transaction fee on my credit card statement?
Some banks and credit cards may impose a fee for international transactions if you're making a booking from outside the U.S.. Your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a fee. The exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined by your bank on the day the transaction is processed by them.
