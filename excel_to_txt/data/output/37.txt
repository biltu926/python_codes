What if I cannot travel and decide to just not show up at the airport? Will my ticket be refundable or changeable?
As stated above, if you cannot travel, you must call us or the airline immediately. If you decide to "just not show up" your itinerary will be marked as a "No Show" and all penalties and restriction mentioned in the previously answered question will apply.
