Why did my flight schedule change?
Some of these changes are minor and may involve a change of aircraft, flight number, or a slight change in departure and/or arrival time. Sometimes the changes are more severe and result in a change to the departure city, arrival city, date of travel or even discontinued service to your destination city. Travelomind will make every effort to notify you if your reservation is impacted by an airline schedule change. Since schedule changes can occur at any time, Travelomind strongly encourages passengers to verify departure times and flight numbers directly with the airlines 24 to 72 hours prior to departure.
