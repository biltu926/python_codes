What happens if I miss my flights?
If you miss your departure flight, the airline reserves the right to mark your ticket as a "No Show" reservation. No show = No Value. This means your ticket cannot be changed or refunded, even with a penalty. If you are en route to the airport and feel you might miss your flight, you MUST call the airline as soon as possible to avoid this "No Show" situation. Once the record has been made a "No Show" reservation, we will no longer have any control in regard to the itinerary or any possible refund. If you've made your departure flight, but you've missed your subsequent flight, you should immediately go to the nearest ticket counter for the airline where you were changing planes. If you've missed your flight you were supposed to change to due to a problem that is within the airline's control, they should protect you on the very next available flight. If you've missed this flight due to something that is not within the airline's control (weather, air traffic, etc.) or due to your own fault, it will be left entirely up to the airline's discretion to protect you or not. If the airline decides that protection is not warranted, it will be up to the passenger to find their own way to their final destination at the passenger's expense. It's also important to note, if you do miss any of your flights ALL CONSEQUENT FLIGHTS ON THE SAME ITINERARY WILL ALSO BE CANCELLED under the "No Show" policy.
