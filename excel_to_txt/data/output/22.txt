There has been a schedule change on my itinerary. Will I get new tickets for my new flights?
Travelomind makes every attempt to notify you of flight changes via email or phone.  However, we are not always made aware of these changes by the airline. It is best if you reconfirm your itinerary directly with the airline at least 72 hours prior to departure. In some cases these changes may require the issuance of a new ticket. Please note, once you have accepted a schedule change from the airline (either by speaking with a representative of the airline or with one of our agents), future changes, requested by you, will require a payment of any applicable penalties and/or fees. If an airline has changed your flight schedule without your request, you will not be charged any fees or penalties for that change.
