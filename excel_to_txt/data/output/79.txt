Why was my request for a refund denied?
Tickets purchased through Travelomind are 100% non-refundable unless otherwise stated. Airline tickets have specific rules regarding changes and cancellations. These rules can not be overwritten by Travelomind. Once you request a cancellation, the rules of your ticket are governed by the airline and any subsequent refund or future travel credit is at their discretion.
