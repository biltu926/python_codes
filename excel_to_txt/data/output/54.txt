How do I get passport information?
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BORDER CROSSING RULES On June 1, 2009, the U.S. government implemented the full requirements of the land and sea phase of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI). The proposed rules require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, entering the United States at air, sea or land ports of entry to have a passport, passport card, or other travel document approved by the Department of Homeland Security. Visit the Department of State's website for full details on the WHTI at http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis_pa_tw_2223.html.
