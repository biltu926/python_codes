How do I request a special meal for my flight?
Most airlines now charge for in-flight meals or no longer offer a meal service. You have an option to place a meal request when you purchase tickets online or you can call the airline directly. Special meal requests must be done at least 24-hours prior to the scheduled departure. These requests are not guaranteed and are at the discretion of the airline.
