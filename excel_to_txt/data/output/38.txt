What documentation or types of photo identification will I need to travel?
Proper documentation will change based on the city you're departing from, the city you are traveling to, where you are changing planes and what country your passport has been issued under. To answer this question accurately, you must call the airline you are traveling and supply them with the necessary information. They will then tell you whether you need a visa, passport or further documentation. Please note, this information is the sole responsibility of the passenger. Neither Travelomind or the airline will be held accountable if you show up at the airport with insufficient or invalid travel documents or identification. It is also important to note, that if you do not have valid or sufficient documents, the airline can deny you boarding and you could be left to find new transportation to your destination at your own cost.
