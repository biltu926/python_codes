How do I select my seats?
You can request seat assignments at the time of booking. When submitting traveler details during booking process, please select "Seat Preference" in the additional requests area If you have already completed your booking, please click the" Request Seat" link which appears under the flight details on your itinerary confirmation e-mail. If pre-assigned seating is available, a seat map will appear. Although we pass your seating request to the respective airlines (wherever applicable), we cannot guarantee that the request will be honored. Please note:
