66,When can I expect my refund?,"When a reservation is cancelled the same day it was booked, funds for the airline portion are not collected. Any pending charges you may have seen would have been a ""pending hold"" for verification. These funds will return to your available credit and will not reflect as a refund. This process normally takes from 3-7 business days, depending on your banking institutions procedures. Please note: Some prepaid credit card companies will hold pending authorizations for up to 30 days. If the airline rules allow for cancellation the day after booking, funds for the airline portion will be refunded within 7-14 business days. It will depend upon the airline(s) and your banking institution's policies. At times the refund will post before the charge is processed or may not appear on your current statement. Please contact your bank to verify the refund was received. "
67,"I did not request a refund, why am I being sent an email stating that I have received one?",These refunds are typically for seat assignment requests that could not be fulfilled by the airline or during a quality check we detected an additional fare savings prior to ticketing your reservation. This refund does not affect your airline ticket purchase.
68,Why do I have mulitple charges on my credit card from Travelomind?,"This occurs when multiple airlines or passengers are booked in a reservation. You will see a charge for each ticket processed separately. Any service fees, taxes or additional services may also show as separate charges with the description of Travelomind. When added together these charges should total the amount you were quoted."

70,Why was I charged more than quoted?,"Confirm with your bank whether the charges in question have posted or are pending to your account. At the time of reservation a ""pending charge"" is placed on your account for the full amount. The bank/credit card company then puts a ""hold"" on that dollar amount, until the transaction either posts or is cleared. With a successful transaction, the charge will typically post to the account within 2-3 business days, at that time the money will be deducted from your account, and the ""hold"" will be released. At times the “pending hold” can show on your account after the charge has posted. Please allow time for the “pending hold” to return to your available credit. Each bank/credit card company has their own time lines to release pending transactions. "
